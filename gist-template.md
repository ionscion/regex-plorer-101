# Regex Email Verification Explanation

In this tutorial, we will be explaining the regex used to verify an email address. 

## Summary

We will be explaining the regex used to verify an email address. This regex is valuable because it can be used to verify that an email address is valid before sending an email to it. This is important because it can prevent the user from entering an invalid email address and having the email bounce back.

The regex we will be using is:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
